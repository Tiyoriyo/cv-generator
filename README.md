# CV Generator Application

## Overview

The CV Generator Application is a dynamic web tool built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It allows users to create and preview their curriculum vitae (CV) in real-time. With this application, you can see how your CV looks as you add information, and everything is automatically styled.

This project was my first experience with React, and while it was challenging at the beginning, I quickly realized the power and efficiency that React brings to web development. The component-based architecture made it easier to manage and update different parts of the application, and the real-time updates provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- Real-time CV preview: As you input your information, the CV preview updates dynamically, allowing you to see the changes immediately.
- Component-based architecture: The entire application is built using React components, making it easy to manage and extend.
- Automatic styling: The application takes care of styling your CV, so you can focus on the content.

## Technologies Used

- React: The core framework for building the application.
- JavaScript: Used for scripting and logic.
- CSS: Styles the components and CV.
- HTML: Defines the structure of the application.
